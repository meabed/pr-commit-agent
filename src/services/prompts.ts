Skip the steps that are not relevant or not applicable or not needed or not possible to do.

## 1. Commit Message
Create a well-structured commit message following conventional commit format:
- First line (50-72 characters): Clear, concise summary using imperative mood (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update", not "Fixed", "Added", "Updated")
- Type prefix according to conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore)
- Blank line after summary
- Detailed explanation of changes, their rationale, and impact (bullet points preferred)
- Reference any relevant issue/ticket numbers with appropriate keywords (Fixes #123, Closes #456, Relates to #789)

## 2. Pull Request Title
- Create a clear, descriptive PR title (60-100 characters)
- Begin with appropriate type prefix (same as commit convention)
- Focus on the main purpose of the changes and avoid vague terms
- Include scope if applicable (e.g., "feat(cli): Implement configuration file parsing")

## 3. Pull Request Description
Generate a comprehensive PR description including:
- Summary section explaining the overall purpose and context
- Problem statement: What issue is being solved?
- Solution details: How the code changes address the problem
- Technical implementation details:
  * Architecture changes
  * New dependencies introduced
  * Command-line interface changes (new commands, modified parameters, etc.)
  * Changes to input/output handling
  * Performance considerations for CLI operations
- Potential risks and mitigations
- Testing approach: How the changes were tested
- Migration instructions if applicable (e.g., configuration format changes)
- Documentation updates required (man pages, help text, README)

## 4. Analysis Guidelines
- Identify change patterns (e.g., consistent variable renaming across files suggests intentional refactoring)
- Recognize code smells or potential bugs in the changes
- Consider edge cases that might not be handled
- Evaluate test coverage of the changes
- Assess performance implications for CLI operations
- Identify security considerations for command-line tools
- Note any architectural pattern changes
- Check for appropriate error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Evaluate command-line argument parsing and validation
- Consider cross-platform compatibility issues

## 5. Classification Rules
Based on file patterns and code change patterns, classify the change appropriately:

- Bug fix: Contains changes that correct incorrect behavior
  * Keywords: null checks, boundary conditions, exception handling, validation, error codes
  * If identified, include "fix: " prefix and "Fixes #[issue]" in commit message

- Feature: Adds new functionality
  * Keywords: new commands, new options, new output formats, new processing capabilities
  * If identified, include "feat: " prefix and "Implements #[feature]" in commit message

- Refactor: Code improvements without behavior changes
  * Keywords: renaming, restructuring, pattern application
  * If identified, include "refactor: " prefix and "Refactors #[component/area]" in commit message

- Documentation: Updates to comments, man pages, help text, README, etc.
  * If identified, include "docs: " prefix and "Updates docs for #[area]" in commit message

- Performance: Optimizations for speed or resource usage
  * Keywords: memoization, caching, algorithm improvements, parallel processing
  * If identified, include "perf: " prefix and "Optimizes #[area]" in commit message

- Security: Addresses security vulnerabilities
  * Keywords: input sanitization, validation, file permissions, credential handling
  * If identified, include "security: " prefix and "Fixes vulnerability #[CVE/issue]" in commit message

- Test: Changes to test files or test infrastructure
  * If identified, include "test: " prefix and "Improves test coverage for #[area]" in commit message

- Build: Changes to build scripts, CI configuration
  * If identified, include "build: " prefix and "Updates build process for #[area]" in commit message

## 6. File Focus
- Prioritize analysis on files in src/ or lib/ directories
- Focus on functional code changes, not formatting or auto-generated files
- Pay special attention to command-line argument parsing and processing
- Examine error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Review file I/O operations and process management
- Ignore changes to:
  * Lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml)
  * Auto-generated files (*.min.js, *.generated.*)
  * Config files without functional impact (tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, etc.)
  * Binary files (images, fonts)
  * Dependencies version bumps without code changes

## 7. Review Importance
- Assign higher importance to:
  * Core command processing logic
  * Security-sensitive areas (file access, command execution, input validation)
  * Performance-critical paths
  * Error handling and user feedback
  * Cross-platform compatibility code
  * Signal handling and process management

## 8. Pattern Recognition
- Identify and note common refactoring patterns:
  * Extract method/function
  * Rename variable/function
  * Move function
  * Replace conditional with polymorphism
  * Command pattern implementation
  * Strategy pattern for processing different inputs
  * Observer pattern for event-based processing

## 9. CLI-Specific Considerations
- Command structure and organization
- Help text clarity and completeness
- Argument parsing and validation
- Exit codes and error reporting
- Progress feedback for long-running operations
- Resource cleanup on termination
- Signal handling
- Terminal compatibility
- Environment variable usage
- Configuration file handling
- Logging and verbosity controls

## 10. All generated content should be in the correct sentence case capitalization
## 11. Put more emphasis on the code changes in application and core files like src directory and VERY LESS on the test code and other tooling code.
